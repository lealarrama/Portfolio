    <meta name="description" content="Hello! I'm passionate about app development for a simple reason: our mobile devices have become integral parts of our daily lives. Think about it - most people reach for their phones first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. Imagine a day without them; it wouldn't be as pleasant or efficient, right? That's why I'm driven to create apps that solve problems and make life easier for users.
    As a Jr. Front End Developer currently based in Dublin, I'm eager to take on new challenges and opportunities. Through my personal projects and learning experiences, I've acquired proficiency in various programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and some MySQL, Node.js, and Express.js. Additionally, I've explored frameworks like React.js and Vite.js. Moreover, I leverage tools like Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.">
